##### 1. Almost 99% of the time, the right time is right now.
> 把握此次此刻，因为会变成永远的彼时彼刻

##### 2. No one is impressed with your possessions as you are.
> 有少许的人会在意你所拥有的，但是哪些更更在意你所在意的，才是志同道合的。打动人的永远是你的细节和品质。

##### 3. Dont ever work for someone you dont want to become.
> 工作的目的在于提成自己，成为自己想成为的那个人。

##### 4. Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 millions people who like you.
> 关注身边的人

##### 5. Dont keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.
> 不要停滞不前，发现问题要改正，找到一个机制避免下次发生。
