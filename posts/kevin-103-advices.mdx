1. Almost 99% of the time, the right time is right now.
   > 把握此次此刻，因为会变成永远的彼时彼刻
2. No one is impressed with your possessions as you are.
   > 有少许的人会在意你所拥有的，但是哪些更更在意你所在意的，才是志同道合的。打动人的永远是你的细节和品质。
3. Dont ever work for someone you dont want to become.
   > 工作的目的在于提成自己，成为自己想成为的那个人。
4. Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 millions people who like you.
   > 关注身边的人
5. Dont keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.
   > 不要停滞不前，发现问题要改正，找到一个机制避免下次发生。
6. If you stop to listen to a musician or stree performer for more than a minute, you owe them a dolloer
   > 对于别人的任何一个优点，都要大声表示肯定。
7. Anything you say before the word "but" does not count.
   > 听清楚别人表达的重点是什么。
8. When you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others, it is a gift to ourselves.
   > 宽恕别人，自己得到益处。
9. Courtesy costs nothing. Lower the toilet seat after use. Let the people in the elevator exit before you enter. Return shopping carts to their designated areas. When you borrow something, return it better shape(filed up, cleaned) than when you got it. 
   > 生活中的点点滴滴，都是修行。
10. Whenever there is an argument between two sides, find the third side.
   > 永远不要把自己放置在二元对立中。
11. Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.
   > 学会休息，是高效工作的前提。千万别burn-out
12. When you lead, you real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.
   > 成为领导的目的在于insipre 其他人也能lead
13. Criticize in private, praise in public.
   > 私下批评，公开表扬
14. Life lessons will be presented to you in the order they are needed. Everything you need to master the lesson is within you. Once you have learned a lesson, you will be presented with next one. If you are alive, that means you still have lessons to learn.
   > 生命中的课程总是不早不晚的到来，到来的时候。到来的挑战，你已经有足够的能力去应对。课程接着课程，挑战接着挑战，不断来临，直到生命终结。
